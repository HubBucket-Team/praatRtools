praatRtools
===========

A very rough bit of R code that allows for acoustic analysis using Praat from R. Requires PraatR, which is available here: http://www.aaronalbin.com/praatr/index.htm, and Praat version 5.3.44 or later. Note that the current (as of November 21 2014) version of Praat available through apt-get will is too old. The binaries here (http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/download_linux.html) are current, though.  

This is still very much a work in progress but I will be actively updating it as development continues.
